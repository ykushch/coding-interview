# Arrays
Problems that relates to arrays.

## Spiral
Given a matrix of `m * n` elements (m rows, n columns), return all elements of the matrix in spiral order.

Example:

Given the following matrix:
```
[
    [ 1, 2, 3 ],
    [ 4, 5, 6 ],
    [ 7, 8, 9 ]
]
```

You should return
```
[1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 8, 7, 4, 5]
```

## CircularShift
Rotate the array A by B positions.

Example:
```
A : [1 2 3 4 5 6]
B : 1
```
The output :
```
[2 3 4 5 6 1]
```
